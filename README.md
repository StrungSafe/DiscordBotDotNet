# FoldingCash's Discord Bot

This is our Discord bot. This bot is intended to provide information and tools to the community via our Discord server.

## TODO

- [X] Add support for windows service (should just need to add UseWindowsService to the startup pipeline)
- [ ] Add a method so that admins can disable/renable commands on demand. Sometimes the infrastructure can go down and we want to disable these functions until they are back up and we don't want to have to change code, compile, and redeploy.
- [ ] Respond by a exclamation point being used too (like !help) so a new user doesn't need to tag the bot directly
